- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JE-Howard, a BCom Information Systems Management undergraduate at Stellenbosch University. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using systems to better streamline processes, especially within the logistics industry.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java Script, Python and SQL. And how these languages can be used as a tool to help bring change to the logistics industry in South Africa.
